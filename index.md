Hi, I’m **Sanjay Singh** — Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn. I build **scalable, reliable, and secure distributed systems**, and I love turning complex infra problems into simple, resilient solutions.

### What I’m focused on
- Kubernetes platform engineering (controllers, schedulers, developer tooling)
- Reverse proxies, service discovery, load balancing
- Zero Trust security: mTLS authorization & SSO authentication
- Access control models, cloud-native architectures, and performance at scale

### Recent highlights
- **Trust Bridge** — reverse proxy + mTLS + SSO for enterprise Zero Trust access control  
- Enabled migration of stateless apps to **Kubernetes** with optimized routing, scaling, and policy enforcement  
- Designed/operated LinkedIn’s **edge/reverse proxy** for incoming traffic, including dynamic routing and client-side load balancing  
- Rolled out **mTLS authorization** & **SSO** across production traffic

I’ll use this space to publish notes and deep dives on Kubernetes, HAProxy, networking, and security.  
If you’re into similar problems, stick around — more posts are coming.
