In today’s enterprise environment, trusting by default is risky. Traditional perimeter-based security assumes that once someone is inside the network, they can be trusted. This model fails under the realities of remote work, BYOD, and hybrid cloud.

That is where Zero Trust Architecture comes in.

## What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security model based on a simple idea: never trust, always verify.

Every request, whether it comes from inside the corporate network or from outside, must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted. Access decisions are made based on who the user is, what device they are using, and how trustworthy that device is at that moment.

## Why use a reverse proxy for Zero Trust?

A reverse proxy acts as a single enforcement point between users and internal applications. By placing authentication and authorization at the proxy layer, I gain:

- **Centralized access control**. Apply security policies across all applications without modifying each one.
- **Device and user identity verification**. Use mTLS for device authentication and SSO for user authentication, then combine them for stronger security.
- **Fast policy updates**. Update access rules in one place and apply them instantly to all protected services.
- **Better observability**. Capture request logs, metrics, and security events from a single point.

## Introducing TrustBridge

TrustBridge is an implementation of this idea. It is a reverse proxy integrated with mTLS and centralized SSO. It enforces Zero Trust principles without requiring code changes in backend applications.

With TrustBridge:
- Every request is verified at the edge.
- Both device and user identities are checked before access is granted.
- Security policies can be updated centrally, which enables rapid response to threats.

## Takeaway

Zero Trust is not a buzzword. It is a necessity for securing modern enterprises. Implementing it by using a reverse proxy gives me a scalable, consistent, and future-proof security layer with built-in auditing, detailed logging, and full observability to monitor and respond to threats effectively.

Stay tuned for future parts of this series, where I will dive deeper into how I built TrustBridge and the lessons I learned along the way.
